 Szabist Event Landing Website Proposal
Submitted by: Naveed Asad Ali
Program: BSCS 5D

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple yet fully functional 3-page website that is
responsive across all devices and browsers. The project will evolve from a static front-end
into a dynamic website built using Laravel. The project will include the use of partial views
to ensure clean and manageable code. In the final phase, dynamic sections and API
endpoints will be introduced, making the website interactive and scalable.

Project Breakdown:
The website will initially focus on the front-end development using HTML, CSS, and
Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. Following this, the static
front-end will be integrated into Laravel using Blade templates, routes, and controllers. This
process will involve breaking the website into partial views for reusable components such
as headers and footers.

Requirements:
The following requirements must be met for this project:
• At least 3 pages (e.g., Home, Event Details, Contact).
• Clean and simple website layout with proper alignment of elements.
• Full responsiveness on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
• Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).
• The front-end must be integrated with Laravel using Blade templates.
• Divide the website into partials to ensure code reusability and maintainability.

Expected Deliverables:
• A static front-end that is fully responsive and designed using good design principles.
• Laravel integration with routes, controllers, and Blade templates.
• Code broken down into partial views (e.g., header, footer) for ease of maintenance.
• Well-documented code with proper commenting and clear structure.
