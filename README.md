Objective:
Students will develop a simple yet fully functional at least 3-page website that is responsive across all devices and browsers. The project will evolve from a static front-end into a dynamic website built using Laravel, including partial views to keep code clean and manageable. The final phase of the project will introduce dynamic sections and expose API endpoints, making the site interactive and scalable.

Project Breakdown:
The students will design and develop the front-end of the website, ensuring it is fully responsive on all devices and browsers. At this stage, the focus will be on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ensuring good design principles like consistency and simplicity.

Requirements: 
 At least 3 pages (e.g., Home, Products, Contact).
The website should be clean and simple with proper alignment of elements.
The website must adapt to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Ensure the website works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
The HTML front-end must be integrated with Laravel using Blade templates, routes, and controllers.
Divide the website into partials (e.g., header, footer) to ensure code reusability.
Expected Deliverables:
Static front-end with fully responsive design.
Code broken into partials for maintainability.
Properly commented code with clear structure.
Submission Deadline:
The project must be submitted before the 7th week class for evaluation and feedback.
